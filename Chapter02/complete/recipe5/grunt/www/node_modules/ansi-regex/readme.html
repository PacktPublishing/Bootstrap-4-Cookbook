<h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Why do you test for codes not in the ECMA 48 standard?</h3><p>Some of the codes we run as a test are codes that we acquired finding various lists of non-standard or manufacturer specific codes. If I recall correctly, we test for both standard and non-standard codes, as most of them follow the same or similar format and can be safely matched in strings without the risk of removing actual string content. There are a few non-standard control codes that do not follow the traditional format (i.e. they end in numbers) thus forcing us to exclude them from the test because we cannot reliably match them.</p>
<p>On the historical side, those ECMA standards were established in the early 90&#39;s whereas the VT100, for example, was designed in the mid/late 70&#39;s. At that point in time, control codes were still pretty ungoverned and engineers used them for a multitude of things, namely to activate hardware ports that may have been proprietary. Somewhere else you see a similar &#39;anarchy&#39; of codes is in the x86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of &quot;interrupts&quot; that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of which have been phased out.</p>
