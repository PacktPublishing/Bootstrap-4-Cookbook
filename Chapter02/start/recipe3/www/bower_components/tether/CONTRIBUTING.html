<h1>Contributing Guide</h1><p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js/io.js &amp; npm</li>
<li>Bower</li>
<li>Gulp</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting started</h2><ol>
<li>Fork the project</li>
<li>Clone your forked project by running <code>git clone git@github.com:{
YOUR_USERNAME }/tether.git</code></li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code> to install both node modules and bower components</li>
<li>Test that you can build the source by moving/renaming the existing <code>dist</code>
directory and running <code>npm run build</code></li>
<li>Assuming everything went well, you should now have a <code>dist</code> directory that
matches the one you moved in step 4</li>
</ol>
<h2>Writing code!</h2><p>We use <code>gulp</code> to facilitate things like transpilation, minification, etc. so
can you focus on writing relevant code. If there is a fix or feature you would like
to contribute, we ask that you take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Most of the <em>editable</em> code lives in the <code>src</code> directory while built code
will end up in the <code>dist</code> directory upon running <code>npm run build</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Depending on how big your changes are, bump the version numbers appropriately
in <code>bower.json</code> and <code>package.json</code>. We try to follow semver, so a good rule
of thumb for how to bump the version is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix to existing code, perform a patch bump e.g. x.x.0 -&gt; x.x.1</li>
<li>New feature, perform a minor bump e.g. x.0.x -&gt; x.1.x</li>
<li>Breaking changes such a rewrite, perform a major bump e.g.
1.x.x -&gt; 2.x.x</li>
</ul>
<p>Versioning is hard, so just use good judgement and we&#39;ll be more than happy
to help out.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There is a <code>gulp</code> task that will automate some of the versioning.
You can run <code>gulp version:{type}</code> where type is <code>patch|minor|major</code> to
update both <code>bower.json</code> and <code>package.json</code> as well as add the appropriate
git tag.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a thoughtful commit message and push your changes to your fork using
<code>git push origin master</code> (assuming your forked project is using <code>origin</code> for
the remote name and you are on the <code>master</code> branch).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open a Pull Request on GitHub with a description of your changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Testing</h2><p>Work in progress. We are hoping to add some tests, so if you would like to help
us get started, feel free to contact us through the Issues or open a Pull
Request.</p>
