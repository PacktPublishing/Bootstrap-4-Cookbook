<p>In this recipe, we continue using a customized version of the navbar used on the official bootstrap 4 website. However, in each recipe, we are also tweaking the navbar slightly, thereby making it easier to notice the differences between each recipe while still working with the exact same links throughout this chapter.</p>

<p>To achieve that, we are setting the <code>flex</code> property to the value of <code>auto</code>, in the custom class of <code>flex-links</code>. This class is used on the <code>ul</code> element inside the <code>div</code> with the class of <code>.navbar-collapse.collapse</code>.</p>
