<h2>Projects Using Tether</h2><p>Here at HubSpot we have built a bunch of libraries on top of Tether,
both because we wanted Tether-performance, and because we saw opportunities
to improve on what was available in the client-side ecosystem.</p>
<h3><a href="http://github.hubspot.com/select/docs/welcome">Select</a></h3><p>Select is a replacement for native browser select elements that is fully stylable.</p>
<h3><a href="http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome">Shepherd</a></h3><p>Shepherd is a library for making tours of your app to help onboard users and show off
new features.</p>
<h3><a href="http://github.hubspot.com/tooltip/docs/welcome">Tooltip</a></h3><p>A simple, easy-to-use implementation of tooltips that works well.</p>
<h3><a href="http://github.hubspot.com/drop/docs/welcome">Drop</a></h3><p>Where Tether does general-purpose positioning, Drop assumes that you are interested
in making something which pops up next to something the user clicks or hovers on.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re building something that fits that pattern, Drop can make things a little easier.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker">React Datepicker</a></h3><p>A simple and reusable datepicker component for React</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-tether">ember-tether</a></h3><p>An Ember.js-friendly interface for tether.</p>
<h3>Your Project Here</h3><p>If you have a cool open-source library built on Tether, PR this doc.</p>
