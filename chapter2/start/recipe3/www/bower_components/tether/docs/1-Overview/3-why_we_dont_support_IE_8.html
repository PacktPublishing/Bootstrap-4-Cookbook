<h2>Why we don&#39;t support IE 8</h2><p>We&#39;ve been living in 2007 for a while now, pretending that new browser features don&#39;t
exist because they aren&#39;t in IE8.  You might not even know about some of these features,
or think they are only enabled by jQuery or underscore, simply because it hasn&#39;t
been an option to rely upon them.</p>
<p>Here is the list of features you don&#39;t have if you choose to support IE 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5 audio and video</li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>TrueType fonts</li>
<li>Media Queries</li>
<li>CSS Transforms</li>
<li>Multiple Backgrounds</li>
<li>CSS3 Units (vh, vw, rem)</li>
<li>Custom DOM events</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated graphics</li>
<li>The DOMContentLoaded event</li>
<li>addEventListener</li>
<li>Object.create, .seal, .freeze, .defineProperty</li>
<li>Array.isArray, .indexOf, .every, .some, .forEach, .map, .filter, .reduce</li>
<li>A modern JavaScript engine</li>
<li>A real developer tools</li>
<li>A consistent box model</li>
<li>jQuery 2</li>
<li>Google Apps</li>
<li>Tether</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s true that IE 8 still holds a big chunk of the browsing population, but the reasons
why they can&#39;t update are dwindling.  There are two big reasons for continuing IE 8 support.</p>
<h4>Enterprises</h4><p>  Microsoft is dropping support for XP in April, organizations who want security updates will have to upgrade.</p>
<h4>China uses XP</h4><p>  Chrome, Firefox and Opera all support XP.  Nothing prevents users from upgrading, except the inertia of
  organizations who still support IE 8.</p>
<h4>The Future</h4><p>We are skating towards where the puck will be, and we hope that as you decide to drop IE 8 support,
you choose to add Tether to the list of awesome things you can do.</p>
