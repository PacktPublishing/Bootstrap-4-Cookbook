<h2>Embedding Tether</h2><p>Tether is designed to be embeddable in other libraries.</p>
<p>There is one thing you should think about doing to create an embedded Tether:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the <code>classPrefix</code> of the tethers you create.  That prefix will replace <code>&#39;tether&#39;</code> in
all of the classes.  You can also disable classes you don&#39;t intend on using with the <code>classes</code>
option.</li>
</ul>
