### Dependencies

[Tether](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/)

### Install with Eager

The easiest way to add a Shepherd tour to your site is with [Eager](http://eager.io).
Click Install to create a tour right on your site with no coding required.

### Usage

First create a new `Tour` instance for your tour:

```coffeescript
tour = new Shepherd.Tour
  defaults:
    classes: 'shepherd-theme-arrows'
    scrollTo: true
```

The `defaults` option allows you to specify any options which should be applied
to all this tour's steps by default.

Next, add your steps:

```coffeescript
tour.addStep 'example-step',
  text: 'This step is attached to the bottom of the <code>.example-css-selector</code> element.'
  attachTo: '.example-css-selector bottom'
  classes: 'example-step-extra-class'
  buttons: [
    text: 'Next'
    action: tour.next
  ]
```

Finally, to start the tour, just call `start` on your `Tour` instance:

```coffeescript
tour.start()
```

### API

#### Global Shepherd Object

Shepherd exposes a single object onto the window, `Shepherd`.

That global object fires several events to let you link up actions with events
occuring in _any_ tour:

##### Methods

- `Shepherd.on(eventName, handler, [context])`: Bind an event
- `Shepherd.off(eventName, [handler])`: Unbind an event
- `Shepherd.once(eventName, handler, [context])`: Bind just the next instance of an event

##### Events

The global Shepherd fires the following events whenever a `Tour` instance fires them.  It adds to the object passed to the
event handlers a `tour` key pointing to the instance which fired the event:

- `complete`
- `cancel`
- `hide`
- `show`
- `start`
- `active`
- `inactive`

##### Current Tour

The global `Shepherd` includes a property which is always set to the currently active tour, or null if there is no active tour:

- `Shepherd.activeTour`

#### Tour Instances

##### Creation

You create a `Tour` object for each tour you'd like to create.

Tour's constructor accepts a hash of options:

```javascript
myTour = new Shepherd.Tour({ options })
```

##### Tour Options

- `steps`: An array of Step instances to initialize the tour with
- `defaults`: Default options for Steps created through `addStep`

##### Tour Methods

- `addStep(id, options)`: Creates a new Step object with options, and returns the `Tour` object for convenient chaining when creating multiple steps.  If you'd like you can also just pass an options hash which includes `id` as a key.
If the options hash doesn't include an `id`, one will be generated.
You can also pass an existing `Step` instance rather than `options`, but note that Shepherd does not support a Step being attached to multiple Tours.
- `getById(id)`: Return a step with a specific id
- `next()`: Advance to the next step, in the order they were added
- `back()`: Show the previous step, in the order they were added
- `cancel()`: Trigger cancel on the current step, hiding it without advancing
- `hide()`: Hide the current step
- `show([id])`: Show the step specified by id (if it's a string), or index (if it's a number) provided.  Defaults to the first step.
- `start()`: Show the first step and begin the tour
- `getCurrentStep()`: Returns the currently shown step
- `on(eventName, handler, [context])`: Bind an event
- `off(eventName, [handler])`: Unbind an event
- `once(eventName, handler, [context])`: Bind just the next instance of an event

##### Tour Events

- `complete`: Triggered when the last step is advanced
- `cancel`
- `hide`
- `show`: Triggered with a hash of the `step` and the `previous` step
- `start`

Steps are instances of the Step object.  They are generally created by the `Tour::addStep` method, which returns the `Step` instance its
created.

#### Steps

##### Step Options

- `text`: The text in the body of the step.  It can be one of four types:
  - HTML string
  - Array of HTML strings
  - `HTMLElement` object
  - Function to be executed when the step is built. It must return one the three options above.
- `title`: The steps title.  It becomes an `h3` at the top of the step.
- `attachTo`: What element the step should be attached to on the page.  It can either be a string of the form `"element on"`, or an object with those properties.  For example: `".some #element left"`, or `{element: '.some #element',
on: 'left'}`.  If you use the object syntax, `element` can also be a DOM element.  If you don't specify an `attachTo`
the element will appear in the middle of the screen.
- `beforeShowPromise`: A function that returns a promise. When the promise resolves, the rest of the `show` code for
the step will execute.
- `classes`: Extra classes to add to the step.  `shepherd-theme-arrows` will give you our theme.
- `buttons`: An array of buttons to add to the step.  By default we add a Next button which triggers `next()`, set this to false
to disable.  Each button in the array is an object of the format:
  - `text`: The HTML text of the button
  - `classes`: Extra classes to apply to the `<a>`
  - `action`: A function executed when the button is clicked on
  - `events`: A hash of events to bind onto the button, for example `{'mouseover': function(){}}`.  Adding a click event to `events` when you
  already have an `action` specified is not supported.
- `advanceOn`: An action on the page which should advance shepherd to the next step.  It can be of the form `"selector event"`, or an object with those
properties.  For example: `".some-element click"`, or `{selector: '.some-element', event: 'click'}`.  It doesn't have to be an event inside
the tour, it can be any event fired on any element on the page.  You can also always manually advance the Tour by calling `myTour.next()`.
- `showCancelLink`: Should a cancel "âœ•" be shown in the header of the step?
- `scrollTo`: Should the element be scrolled to when this step is shown?
- `when`: You can define show, hide, etc events inside when. For example:
```js
when: {
        show: function() {
          window.scrollTo(0, 0);
        }
      }
```
- `tetherOptions`: Extra options to pass to [tether](http://github.hubspot.com/tether)

##### Step Methods

- `show()`: Show this step
- `hide()`: Hide this step
- `cancel()`: Hide this step and trigger the `cancel` event
- `complete()`: Hide this step and trigger the `complete` event
- `scrollTo()`: Scroll to this step's element
- `isOpen()`: Returns true if the step is currently shown
- `destroy()`: Remove the element
- `on(eventName, handler, [context])`: Bind an event
- `off(eventName, [handler])`: Unbind an event
- `once(eventName, handler, [context])`: Bind just the next instance of an event

##### Step Events

- `before-show`
- `show`
- `before-hide`
- `hide`
- `complete`
- `cancel`
- `destroy`

Please note that `complete` and `cancel` are only ever triggered if you call the associated methods in your code.

### Advancing on Actions

You can use the `advanceOn` option, or the Next button, to advance steps.  If you would like however to have a step advance on a
complex user action, you can do the following:

```coffeescript
myStep = myTour.addStep 'my-step', options

yourApp.on 'some-event', ->
  if myStep.isOpen()
    Shepherd.activeTour.next()
```

It's strongly recommended that you use some sort of event mediator to connect your app's actions with Shepherd, to prevent
having to sprinkle Shepherd code throughout your codebase, and to keep things loosely coupled.  You can create a basic
mediator if need be using the `Evented` object which is provided with Shepherd:

```coffeescript
mediator = new Shepherd.Evented
```

You can then trigger events in one part of your app:

```coffeescript
mediator.trigger 'user-create'
```

And listen for them in other areas:

```coffeescript
mediator.on 'user-create', ->
```
