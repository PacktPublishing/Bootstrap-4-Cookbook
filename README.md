This is the code repository for [Bootstrap 4 Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/bootstrap-4-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785889295), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Bootstrap, one of the most popular front-end frameworks, is perfectly built to design elegant, powerful, and responsive interfaces for professional-level web pages. It supports responsive design by dynamically adjusting your web page layout.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
    "name": "customGrunt",
    "version": "",
    "devDependencies": {
        "grunt": "~1.0.1",
        "grunt-contrib-copy": "^1.0.0"
    }
}
```

In almost all the chapters of this book, the following technologies are used:

* Node and NPM
* Bower
* Ruby and Jekyll
* Git and Git Bash
* Harp

Chapter 11, Bootstrap 4 with ASP.net Core, is specific because it requires that you have an
installation of Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition and a .NET Core 1.x installation.
Chapter 12, Integrating Bootstrap 4 with React and Angular, requires installations of React and
Angular via npm.
